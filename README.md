## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or yarn

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/roskoe432/portfolio-web.git
cd portfolio-web

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Open https://localhost:5173
```

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm start              # Start dev server
npm run build          # Production build
npm run serve          # Preview production build
npm test               # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage  # Generate coverage report
npm run lint           # Lint code
npm run lint:fix       # Fix linting issues
npm run format         # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check   # Check code formatting
```

## 🧪 Testing

The project maintains high test coverage with comprehensive unit and integration tests:

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# View coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

Test coverage includes:

- Component rendering and behavior
- User interactions and form validation
- Routing and navigation
- i18n translations
- Custom hooks

## 🐳 Docker

Build and run the containerized application:

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t portfolio-web .

# Run container
docker run -p 8080:80 portfolio-web

# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

## ☁️ Deployment

### Infrastructure

The project uses **Terraform** to provision Azure infrastructure:

- **Azure Container Registry** - Private Docker image storage
- **Azure Container Apps** - Serverless container hosting
- **Custom domain** with SSL/TLS
- **Remote state** management in Azure Storage

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### CI/CD Pipelines

**GitHub Actions** automate the entire deployment workflow:

#### Check Pipeline (Feature Branches)

- Runs on `feature/**` and `hotfix/**` branches
- Executes tests with coverage reporting
- Builds Docker image
- Validates Terraform configuration
- Posts coverage report to PR

#### Deploy Pipeline (Main Branch)

- Provisions/updates Azure infrastructure
- Builds and pushes Docker image to ACR
- Deploys to Azure Container Apps
- Zero-downtime deployments

### Security

- **OIDC authentication** - No stored credentials
- **GitHub Secrets** - Encrypted secret management
- **Environment-based** federated credentials
- **HTTPS only** - SSL/TLS certificates
